## Description

This is an Interactive Full-Stack Application for creating posts/reviews with complaints regarding any place or business.
Our motivation was to practice our collaborative skills, coding abilitiesthe and knowlege we've got during the past six modules of the boot camp to create a real-world full-stack application.
The aim was to create a blog sitesimilar to Yelp, where users can publish a claim to anything - this is world for the real "haters". So other haters/users could look through the blog and give likes/dislikes to the posts.
In this application we fulfil the following requirements:

* Use Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API.

* Use Handlebars.js as the template engine.

* Use MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database.

* Have both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data.

* Use at least one new library, package, or technology that we havenâ€™t discussed in the boot camp. We used two new packages: the Cloudinary's Programmable Media solution enables us to programmatically add image upload, transformation, optimization, and delivery capabilities to our applications via easy-to-use REST APIs. And the Passport JS.....

* Have a folder structure that meets the MVC paradigm.

* Include authentication (express-session and cookies). For authentication we also used The PassportJS package.....

* Protect API keys and sensitive information with environment variables.

* Be deployed using Heroku (with data).

* Have a polished UI.

* Be responsive.

* Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

* Meet good-quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).
